# Glow Issue Tracker

Welcome to the **Glow Engine Bug Tracker**, the central place for reporting and tracking issues related to the **Glow Engine** theming system.

## 🐛 Reporting Bugs

When filing an issue, please include as much detail as possible. 

## 🚫 What *Not* to Report

Glow Engine relies on a stable environment and functional injection layer (Ammonia).  
Issues related to **SIP (System Integrity Protection)** or other macOS security components will **not** be investigated here — these are almost always user-side setup problems.

Before opening a bug:

1. Ensure **SIP is properly configured or disabled** as required.  
2. Confirm that **Ammonia** is installed and operational.  
   - Ammonia is the low-level injection framework that GlowEngine depends on.  
   - If Ammonia fails to load or hook correctly, GlowEngine will not initialize.
  
  Thanks!
